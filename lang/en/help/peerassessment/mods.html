<div class="indent">
The Peer Assessment Activity (PAA) module allows group members to rate themselves and the other group members.
</div>
<div class="indent">
There are 2 modes that the PAA module can be used:
<ol>
<li>Associated with an Assignment</li>
<li>Unassociated with an Assignment</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><b>Associated Assignment Mode</b></p>
<div class="indent">
<p>In this mode the Peer Assessment Activity is associated with a specific assignment in the course.</p>
<p>The groups that are configured for the associated activity are used to control the list of students that users are able to rate.</p> 
</div>
<p><b>No Associated Assignment Mode</b>  </p>
<div class="indent">
<p>In this mode the activity is not associated with any specific assignment.</p>
<p>You will need to specify what group information is used.</p>  
</div>
<!--
<p><b>Default Capability Configuration</b></p>
<div class="indent">
<p>The default configuration for Peer Assessment activities is that "students" get the "recordrating" capability. This means that they are able to rate the other users in their groups.</p>
<p>By default tutors <strong>do not</strong> have this capability turned on.</p>
<p>If you require tutors to be able to contribute to ratings, you <strong>override</strong> the "recordrating" capability to be "ALLOW" on the Peer Assessments you want to this to 
take place on.</p>
